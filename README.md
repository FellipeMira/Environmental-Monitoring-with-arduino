# Environmental-Monitoring-with-arduino
Using APIs and bots (telegram) to access data from spatially distributed arduino sensors

### libraries were used:
`{sp, sf, arduinor, tidyverse, plotly, maptools, spatstat, raster, telegram.bot}`


### The monitoring performed by the arduino systems is observed in real time by the project. This monitoring is accessed by a smartphone, using a bot created in the app telegram.  

### The flowchart of the processes can be explained by the figure below
