# Environmental Monitoring with arduino
Using APIs and bots (telegram) to access data from spatially distributed arduino sensors

### libraries were used:
`{sp, sf, arduinor, tidyverse, plotly, maptools, spatstat, raster, telegram.bot,flexdashboard and tmap}`

### materials
* Arduino UNO 
* DHT11
* RTC
* SD card module
* Soil Moisture Sensor

### The monitoring performed by the arduino systems is observed in real time by the project. This monitoring is accessed by a smartphone, using a bot created in the app telegram.  

As can be seen in the images, the monitoring can be followed via telegram, with just a few commands you can generate maps of each of the sensors, dashboards, and the results of all the sensors at the same time.
